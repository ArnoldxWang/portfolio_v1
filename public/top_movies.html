    Amazing openning sequence, great character establishment. <br>
    Fights are well choreographed, suspense is immense whenever joker is on screen. <br>
    Fun Fact: Christian bale was asked to be batman for the DCEU however <br>
    because Christopher Nolan was unavailable to direct, he refused.

<h3> EX Machina (animated) </h3>

    Watched this movie when I was young and thoroughly enjoyed it. <br>
    From what I can remember it is regarding the progression of technology in a <br>
    new age where people are already cybernetically enhanced. <br>
    However, new technology has lead to a hijacking of these cybernetics in people <br>

<h3> Superbad </h3>

    This movie is a cultural icon. Superbad follows 3 highschool kids on the verge of graduation <br>
    Realizing this new chapter of life will leave them seperated unable to spend <br>
    everyday together hanging out and having fun, they decide to try party and rizz girls <br>
    Great journey and probably one of the last genuinely funny movies before everything went woke <br>
