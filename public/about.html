<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2> Arnold </h2>
<h3> Career </h3>
<p>
  My name is Arnold. I am a python developer with a focus on data engineering, data science and data analytics.
  My passion for all things data stems from my background education having studied mathematics at the University of
  Toronto
  along with my experience learning Data Science at Brain Station. I like to think of data as the files our brains that
  drive our everyday
  decisions from what we do to where we go to who we choose to do these activities with.

<h3> Passions </h3>
<p>
  Currently, I like to wind down by playing sports. While it gets difficult to stick to one activity with Toronto's ever
  changing seasons
  and bipolar weather, I keep things interesting by constantly adapting. Golf / Cycling during the summers and
  Basketball / Volleyball
  during the winters.
